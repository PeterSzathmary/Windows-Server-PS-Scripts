.SYNOPSIS
    Disable maps broker service.
.DESCRIPTION
    What is Windows MapsBroker?
    Maps. Some map apps, such as Windows Maps, depend on the Downloaded Maps Manager service,
    also known as MapsBroker. If you download offline maps, this service runs in the background to keep
    them up to date. Because it only runs occasionally, it consumes very few system resources.
